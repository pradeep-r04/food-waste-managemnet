        <h2>About Daawat</h2>
        <p><strong>Daawat</strong> is more than just an app‚Äîit's a community movement aiming to eliminate food wastage and hunger by connecting people who have excess food with those who need it the most. With a simple hosting and attending mechanism, Daawat empowers individuals to make a meaningful difference in their neighborhoods, one meal at a time.</p>

        <h3>üìå How We Are Helping</h3>
        <p>Daawat creates an ecosystem where surplus food can be rescued and redirected before it is wasted. Our key efforts include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peer-to-peer food sharing:</strong> Anyone with extra food can become a host and make it available for pickup or dining.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time food availability:</strong> Users can view nearby "Daawats" (food events) in real time and attend them before the food goes to waste.</li>
          <li><strong>Hyperlocal impact:</strong> By focusing on nearby users, we ensure fast and accessible redistribution of food, reducing logistical barriers.</li>
          <li><strong>Community support:</strong> We uplift marginalized communities by ensuring they have access to nutritious meals through community generosity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üåç The Reality</h3>
        <p>Food waste is a major problem in India. According to the United Nations, India wastes over <strong>68 million tons of food every year</strong>‚Äîfood that could feed the country's undernourished population several times over. At the same time, over <strong>190 million people</strong> in India struggle with hunger or malnutrition daily.</p>
        <p>The majority of food waste comes from households, restaurants, weddings, and large events. Often, this food is perfectly edible but discarded due to lack of awareness, poor planning, or absence of a reliable redistribution system.</p>
        <p><strong>Daawat</strong> was born to bridge that gap‚Äîto turn waste into nourishment, and indifference into action.</p>

        <h3>ü§ù What We Expect from You</h3>
        <p>We believe everyone has a role to play in creating a waste-free, hunger-free society. Here's how you can contribute:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Host a Daawat:</strong> Whenever you have leftover or surplus food‚Äîbe it from daily meals, functions, or celebrations‚Äîcreate a post on Daawat. Share details like food type, location, and pickup time.</li>
          <li><strong>Attend a Daawat:</strong> If you're in need of food or know someone who is, explore nearby Daawats and collect food respectfully and responsibly.</li>
          <li><strong>Spread awareness:</strong> Tell your friends, family, and community about Daawat. Help normalize food sharing and reduce the stigma around receiving shared food.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect community values:</strong> We expect users to be honest, responsible, and kind in all interactions‚Äîwhether hosting or attending.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üéØ How It Aligns with WHO‚Äôs 2030 Goals</h3>
        <p>Daawat directly supports global sustainability and health goals, including those laid out by the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> and the <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> for 2030:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Goal 2: Zero Hunger</strong> ‚Äì By redirecting food to people who need it, we work toward eradicating hunger and malnutrition in local communities.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> ‚Äì Daawat encourages conscious consumption and reduces the environmental footprint caused by food waste.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being</strong> ‚Äì Access to safe, nutritious food is a key component of physical and mental well-being, particularly for vulnerable populations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By choosing to be part of Daawat, you become a contributor to a more equitable, sustainable, and healthier future‚Äîfor your community and for the planet.</p>
